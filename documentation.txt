Introduction:
Wingman is a C++ project designed to control prosthetic limbs using computer vision techniques and signal processing algorithms. It allows users to intuitively control their prosthetic limbs through gestures and muscle signals, providing a more natural and responsive interface.

Features:
- EMG Signal Processing: Process electromyography (EMG) signals to extract muscle activity data.
- Gesture Recognition: Recognize user gestures from EMG signals or external commands.
- Virtual Prosthetic Limb: Simulate the movement of a prosthetic limb based on control commands.
- Simulation Environment: Provide a graphical or command-line interface for users to interact with the software in a simulated environment.
- Filtering Algorithms: Implement low-pass, high-pass, and notch filters to remove noise from EMG signals.

Getting Started:
To get started with the Prosthetic Limb Control Software, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (Armadillo, etc.).
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

Usage:
Wingman can be used for various applications, including:
- Research and development of prosthetic limb control systems.
- Rehabilitation and therapy for individulals with limb disabilities.
- Educational purposes in computer science, biomedical engineering, and related fields.

Modules:
The software consists of the following modules:
- EMG Signal Processing: Process EMG signals to extract relevant muscle activity data.
- Gesture Recognition: Recognize user gestures from processed EMG signals.
- Control Logic: Translate recognized gestures into control commands for the virtual prosthetic limb.
- Simulation Environment: Provide a simulated environment for user interaction and testing.

Examples:
Here are some examples demonstrating the usage of Wingman:
1. Basic Usage: Simulate control of a prosthetic limb using pre-recorded EMG signals.
2. Gesture Recognition: Train the software to recognize specific gestures for controlling the prosthetic limb.
3. Real-time Control: Interface with hardware devices to control a physical prosthetic limb in real-time.
