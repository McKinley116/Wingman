Setting Up Environment for OpenCV and Arduino (Without Physical Board)

1. Virtual Arduino Environment:
   - Utilize a virtual Arduino environment like Tinkercad (https://www.tinkercad.com/) to simulate Arduino boards and their behavior.

2. Tinkercad Setup:
   - Sign up for a free account on Tinkercad.
   - Create a new circuit project and add an Arduino board and a servo motor component to the workspace.

3. Write and Test Code:
   - Use Tinkercad's Arduino code editor to write your Arduino code that uses the Servo library.
   - Test your code within the Tinkercad environment to verify its behavior.

4. Serial Communication:
   - Simulate serial communication within your C++ code since physical Arduino communication won't be possible.
   - Use a library like SerialComm (https://github.com/pviseu/SerialComm) to establish virtual serial communication.

5. C++ Development:
   - Set up your C++ development environment with OpenCV.
   - Write your C++ code to interact with the virtual Arduino environment using simulated serial communication.

6. Testing and Debugging:
   - Test your software within the virtual environment to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Debug any issues and make necessary adjustments to your code.
