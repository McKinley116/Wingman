# Project Title: Prosthetic Limb Control Software for Veterans

# Project Description:
//The goal of this project is to develop intuitive software to control prosthetic limbs using computer vision techniques, specifically tailored to meet the needs of veterans. The software will interpret muscle signals or external commands to enable veterans to control their prosthetic limbs seamlessly.

# Key Features:

Gesture Recognition: Implement computer vision algorithms to recognize and interpret gestures made by the user, such as muscle contractions or hand movements.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface where veterans can customize and calibrate their prosthetic limb control settings based on their individual preferences and capabilities.
Real-time Feedback: Provide real-time visual and auditory feedback to users to help them monitor their movements and adjust their control inputs accordingly.
Adaptability: Incorporate machine learning techniques to adapt the control algorithms over time, allowing the software to learn from the user's movements and improve its accuracy and responsiveness.
Accessibility: Ensure that the software is accessible to veterans with different levels of mobility and dexterity by offering customizable control options and support for alternative input devices.
Integration: Explore integration possibilities with existing prosthetic limb hardware and assistive technologies to provide a seamless user experience.
Documentation and Support: Provide comprehensive documentation and support resources to help veterans and healthcare professionals understand and utilize the software effectively.

# Potential Technologies/Libraries:

OpenCV for computer vision algorithms
C++ for software development
Machine learning frameworks for adaptability (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
GUI libraries for user interface development (e.g., Qt)
ROS framework

# Impact:
By developing this software, veterans will have access to a customizable and intuitive solution for controlling their prosthetic limbs, empowering them to regain independence and improve their overall quality of life. The project aims to contribute to the well-being and rehabilitation of veterans by leveraging technology to address their unique needs and challenges.

# How will we simulate?
ROS provides a comprehensive framework for building robotic systems, including simulation capabilities that are well-suited for modeling and testing prosthetic limbs.
