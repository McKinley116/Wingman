ValorOS (Veteran built, Veteran Inspired)

ValorOS is a program dedicated to empowering veterans with intuitive software designed to control prosthetic limbs using advanced computer vision techniques. Tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of veterans, this software interprets muscle signals or external commands, enabling seamless control over prosthetic limbs.

Project Phases:
1. Research and Planning:
   - Conduct research on existing prosthetic limb control systems and technologies.
   - Gather requirements from veterans and healthcare professionals to understand user needs and preferences.
   - Plan the overall architecture and design of the software, including key features and technology stack.

2. Prototyping:
   - Develop prototypes for individual components, such as gesture recognition algorithms and hardware interfaces.
   - Test prototypes with target users to gather feedback and iterate on design and functionality.

3. Implementation:
   - Develop the software according to the planned architecture and design.
   - Implement gesture recognition algorithms, real-time feedback mechanisms, adaptability features, and integration with Arduino for hardware control.

4. Testing and Validation:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and usability of the software.
   - Validate the software with veterans and healthcare professionals to verify its effectiveness and suitability.

5. Deployment and Maintenance:
   - Prepare the software for deployment in clinical settings and prosthetic limb clinics.
   - Provide training and support to users and healthcare professionals on how to use the software effectively.
   - Continuously monitor and maintain the software to address any issues or bugs that arise post-deployment.

Libraries Included:
- OpenCV: A widely used computer vision library for implementing gesture recognition algorithms and processing visual feedback.
- C++: The primary programming language for software development, used for implementing core functionality.
- Arduino: Hardware interfacing platform for controlling physical prosthetic limb components.

Impact:
By developing this software, veterans will have access to a customizable and intuitive solution for controlling their prosthetic limbs, empowering them to regain independence and improve their overall quality of life. The project aims to contribute to the well-being and rehabilitation of veterans by leveraging technology to address their unique needs and challenges.
