## Key Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Implement computer vision algorithms to recognize and interpret gestures made by the user, such as muscle contractions or hand movements.
- **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface where veterans can customize and calibrate their prosthetic limb control settings based on their individual preferences and capabilities.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide real-time visual and auditory feedback to users to help them monitor their movements and adjust their control inputs accordingly.
- **Adaptability:** Incorporate machine learning techniques to adapt the control algorithms over time, allowing the software to learn from the user's movements and improve its accuracy and responsiveness.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the software is accessible to veterans with different levels of mobility and dexterity by offering customizable control options and support for alternative input devices.
- **Integration:** Explore integration possibilities with existing prosthetic limb hardware and assistive technologies to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Documentation and Support:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support resources to help veterans and healthcare professionals understand and utilize the software effectively.

## Potential Technologies/Libraries

- OpenCV for computer vision algorithms
- C++ for software development
- Machine learning frameworks for adaptability (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- GUI libraries for user interface development (e.g., Qt)
- ROS framework

## Impact

By developing this software, veterans will have access to a customizable and intuitive solution for controlling their prosthetic limbs, empowering them to regain independence and improve their overall quality of life. The project aims to contribute to the well-being and rehabilitation of veterans by leveraging technology to address their unique needs and challenges.
