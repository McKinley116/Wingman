Wingman ( Veteran Inspired)

Wingman is a program dedicated to empowering veterans with intuitive software designed to control prosthetic limbs using advanced computer vision techniques. Tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of veterans, this software interprets muscle signals or external commands, enabling seamless control over prosthetic limbs.(SIMULATED)

EMG Signal Processing:
- Use standard C++ libraries or specific signal processing libraries like Armadillo or FFTW to process EMG signals.
- Implement filters (e.g., low-pass, high-pass) for noise reduction and feature extraction techniques (e.g., RMS, MAV) to extract relevant information from the EMG signals.
- Develop algorithms to classify different muscle patterns and map them to specific movements or actions of the prosthetic limb.

Gesture Recognition:
- Design custom algorithms or use machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn for gesture recognition.
- Collect data from simulated or emulated gestures and train a classifier to recognize different gestures.
- Implement algorithms to interpret recognized gestures and translate them into corresponding control commands for the prosthetic limb.

Integration and Control:
- Integrate the EMG signal processing and gesture recognition modules into a unified control system for the prosthetic limb.
- Develop software interfaces to communicate with the virtual prosthetic limb model or simulation environment.
- Implement control logic to translate processed signals and recognized gestures into appropriate movements and actions of the prosthetic limb.

Simulation Environment:
- Create a simulated environment where users can interact with the prosthetic limb control software.
- Develop a graphical or command-line interface for users to input simulated EMG signals or gestures.
- Implement a virtual prosthetic limb model that responds to control commands generated by the software.

Testing and Evaluation:
- Test the prosthetic limb control software in the simulated environment with simulated inputs.
- Gather feedback from users on the usability, responsiveness, and intuitiveness of the control system.
- Iterate on the software design and algorithms based on user feedback to improve performance and user experience.
