# Wingman - Gesture Recognition System

## Project Overview

The Wingman project aims to develop a gesture recognition system that can filter, generate, store, and classify electromyography (EMG) signals as gestures using machine learning algorithms. The system will serve as a tool to interpret human gestures, particularly for applications such as prosthetic control, virtual reality interaction, or human-computer interaction.

## Key Features

- **EMG Signal Filtering**: Algorithms to filter raw EMG signals to remove noise and artifacts.
- **EMG Signal Generation**: Methods to generate simulated EMG signals representing various gestures.
- **Data Storage**: A robust system for storing both raw and processed EMG signals, along with associated metadata.
- **Gesture Classification Algorithms**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for gesture classification based on EMG signals.

## Objectives

- Develop signal processing algorithms to filter raw EMG signals effectively.
- Implement methods to generate simulated EMG signals representing various gestures.
- Design a robust data storage system for storing EMG signals and associated metadata.
- Investigate and implement machine learning algorithms for gesture classification based on EMG signals.
- Evaluate the performance of the gesture recognition system through extensive testing and validation.
