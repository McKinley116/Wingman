1. Initialize:
   - Initialize servo motor objects for each finger.
   - Initialize sensor objects (e.g., flex sensors, force sensors).
   - Initialize variables for finger positions, grip strength, and user input.

2. Setup:
   - Configure pin modes for servo motors and sensors.
   - Calibrate servo motors for their neutral positions.
   - Set up serial communication for debugging or user interaction.

3. Main Loop:
   - Read sensor inputs:
     - Read flex sensor values to determine finger positions.
     - Read force sensor values to adjust grip strength.
   - Map sensor inputs to desired finger positions and grip strength.
   - Update servo motor positions based on the mapped values.
   - Check for user input from the interface (if applicable) for additional commands.
   - Output feedback data to serial monitor or user interface for monitoring.

4. Functions:
   - Function to map sensor inputs to servo motor positions:
     - Map flex sensor values to corresponding angles for each finger.
     - Map force sensor values to grip strength levels.
   - Function to control servo motors:
     - Accept servo position values as input and move the servo motors accordingly.
   - Function to read sensor values:
     - Read analog sensor values and return the readings.
   - Function for user interface (if applicable):
     - Implement commands for controlling finger movements and grip strength.

5. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling mechanisms for sensor failures or communication errors.
   - Set default behavior for safe operation in case of unexpected inputs.

6. Testing and Validation:
   - Test individual components (servo motors, sensors) for proper functionality.
   - Test integrated system for accurate finger movements and grip adjustments.
   - Validate user interface (if applicable) for usability and responsiveness.

7. Documentation:
   - Document the pseudocode, including function descriptions and variable definitions.
   - Provide comments within the code to explain key logic and decision points.

8. Deployment:
   - Deploy the code to the Arduino microcontroller.
   - Verify proper operation in the target environment.
   - Conduct final testing and calibration before deployment.

9. Maintenance:
   - Monitor system performance for any issues or malfunctions.
   - Implement software updates or hardware adjustments as needed.
   - Provide user training and support for troubleshooting.

10. Review and Iterate:
    - Collect feedback from users and stakeholders.
    - Review system performance against project objectives.
    - Iterate on the code and hardware design to address any identified issues or improvements.
